/**
 * Determines the display state of a given timestamp based on its relation to the current time.
 *
 * @param timestamp The `Instant` representing the time to be evaluated.
 * @return A [MessageTimeState] that represents how the timestamp should be displayed:
 * - [MessageTimeState.SentNow]: If the timestamp is within 5 minutes (past or future) from the current time.
 * - [MessageTimeState.ShowTime]: If the timestamp falls on today's date but is not within 5 minutes of the current time.
 * - [MessageTimeState.ShowDate]: If the timestamp is on a date other than today.
 *
 * ### Examples:
 * - If the timestamp is within 5 minutes of now:
 *     Returns `MessageTimeState.SentNow`.
 * - If the timestamp is from earlier today:
 *     Returns `MessageTimeState.ShowTime` (e.g., displayed as `14:45`).
 * - If the timestamp is from a previous or future date:
 *     Returns `MessageTimeState.ShowDate` (e.g., displayed as `10.01.2025`).
 *
 * @see MessageTimeState for the possible states and their representations.
