/**
 * A password can be a regular password or multireference password
 *
 * * A "regular password" is used to store a secret, which is usually only known to one cardholder. The COS will allow certain services only if this secret has been successfully presented as part of a user verification. The need for user verification can be turned on (enable) or turned off (disable).
 * * A multireference password allows the use of a secret, which is stored as an at-tributary in a regular password (see (N015.200)), but under conditions that deviate from those of the regular password.
