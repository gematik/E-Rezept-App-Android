 * @param block The write operation to perform inside the Realm transaction.

/**
 * Performs a **Realm write operation with retry support** using exponential backoff.
 *
 * This method:
 * - Attempts the provided [block] within a Realm write transaction.
 * - Retries on failure up to [maxRetries] times with exponential backoff.
 * - Logs the success, failure, and retry attempts using [Napier].
 * - Handles specific exceptions like [IllegalStateException], [RealmException], and [IOException].
 *
 * **When to use:**
 * Use this method when your write operations are critical and need retry support in case of failures.
 * Ideal for operations like syncing or persisting critical data.
 *
 * @param maxRetries The maximum number of retry attempts (default is 1).
 * @param initialDelay The initial delay in milliseconds before retrying (default is 100ms).
 * @param block The write operation to perform inside the Realm transaction.
 * @return The result of the [block] execution.
 * @throws Throwable If all retry attempts are exhausted or an unexpected error occurs.
