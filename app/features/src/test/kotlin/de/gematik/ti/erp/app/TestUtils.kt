/**
 * Retrieves the current value of a private [StateFlow] property from the given instance using Kotlin reflection.
 *
 * This utility is intended for use in **unit tests** to verify internal state held in private or internal
 * `StateFlow` properties of a class, such as `ViewModel`s, without requiring changes to visibility.
 *
 * ### Example usage:
 * ```
 * val taskIds: List<String> = getPrivateStateFlowValue(viewModel, "selectedTaskIdsFromOrder")
 * assertEquals(listOf("task-1"), taskIds)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Parameters:
 * @param T The expected return type of the value inside the StateFlow.
 * @param instance The object instance containing the private StateFlow property.
 * @param propertyName The name of the private property to retrieve (must be a [StateFlow]).
 *
 * ### Returns:
 * The current value stored inside the [StateFlow] property.
 *
 * ### Throws:
 * - [NoSuchElementException] if the property with the given name is not found.
 * - [IllegalStateException] if the property exists but is not a [StateFlow].
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - This function uses Kotlin reflection and `isAccessible = true` to bypass visibility modifiers like `private` or `internal`.
 * - Only use this in testing scenarios. It should **not** be used in production code.
 * - Requires the `kotlin-reflect` library to be present in your test dependencies.
