/**
 * Defines a shared navigation graph that includes both the [redeemGraph] and [pharmacyGraph].
 *
 * This graph is useful for scenarios where both redemption and pharmacy flows need to access shared state,
 * such as a shared [de.gematik.ti.erp.app.redeem.presentation.OnlineRedeemSharedViewModel],
 * without exposing it to the rest of the app.
 *
 * By nesting both graphs under a common route, view models scoped to [RedeemAndPharmacyGraphRoutes.subGraphName]
 * will be retained across navigation between redemption and pharmacy-related screens, but will reset when exiting
 * to other parts of the app.
 *
 * @param dependencyInjector The DI container providing dependencies for the pharmacy graph, which needs to be modified.
 * @param navController The [NavController] used for navigating within the graph.
 * @param startDestination The initial route when this graph is entered. Defaults to the "How to Redeem" screen.
