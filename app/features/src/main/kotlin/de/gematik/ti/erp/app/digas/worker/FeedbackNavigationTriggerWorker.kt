/**
 * A [CoroutineWorker] responsible for triggering a navigation-related event for a specific profile.
 *
 * This worker is typically scheduled with a profile ID as input and is used to trigger
 * one-time events such as feedback prompts or in-app guidance flows after a delay.
 *
 * Dependencies are injected via Kodein using the application context.
 *
 * Input:
 * - `profileId`: A string passed via `workDataOf("profileId" to ...)` identifying the target profile.
 *
 * Output:
 * - [Result.success] if the trigger was applied successfully.
 * - [Result.failure] if the profileId is missing or the use case throws an exception.
 *
 * @param appContext The application context (used to retrieve DI container).
 * @param workerParams The worker parameters provided by WorkManager.
