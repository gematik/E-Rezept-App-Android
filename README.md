### Installation
To create and install an unsigned debug.apk on your connected android device, run:
- "./gradlew :app:android:assembleGoogleTuInternalDebug" in your terminal. 
  - This will create an apk in the following path "app/android/build/outputs/apk/googleTuInternal/debug", which you can then install on your device
  - run "adb install app/android/build/outputs/apk/googleTuInternal/debug/android-googleTuInternal-debug.apk"
- or click on the green "run"-Button in the top right of android studio.

## Usage
The installed debug.apk can't communicate to connected servers. It's purpose is for local testing only. To show some data, you can enter the demo-mode via the settings.
