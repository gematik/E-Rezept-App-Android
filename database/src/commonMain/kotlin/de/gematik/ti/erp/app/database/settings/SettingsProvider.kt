expect fun provideSettings(): Settings

/**
 * Provides a [Settings] instance suitable for the current platform.
 *
 * This function is defined as an `expect` in common code and implemented
 * separately for each platform (e.g., Android, JVM/desktop, iOS).
 *
 * ## Platform-specific implementations:
 * - **Android**: Wraps `SharedPreferences` via [SharedPreferencesSettings]
 * - **Desktop (JVM)**: Uses Java's `Preferences` API via [PreferencesSettings]
 * - **iOS/macOS**: Uses `NSUserDefaults` via [AppleSettings] *(if implemented)*
 *
 * ## Usage:
 * Call this in shared or platform code to get access to key-value storage:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val sharedPrefs = provideSettings()
 *
 * // Store values
 * sharedPrefs.putString("auth_token", "abc123")
 *
 * // Retrieve values
 * val token = sharedPrefs.getStringOrNull("auth_token")
 *
 * // Remove a specific key
 * sharedPrefs.remove("auth_token")
 *
 * // Clear all stored keys
 * sharedPrefs.clear()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Purpose:
 * Used for storing user preferences, feature flags, auth tokens, and other
 * simple key-value pairs that must persist across sessions. Ideal for use in
 * Kotlin Multiplatform Projects (KMP) where consistent access to preferences
 * is needed across Android, desktop, and iOS targets.
 *
 * @return A platform-appropriate [Settings] implementation
